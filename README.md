DirectRpc
=========

Highly Controllable Java Rpc framework

Wiki is under construction, and will release it's first version before Oct. 5th, 2013.

But I am pleased to announce that the "SnifferMouse" which is used to monitor remote outputs in "DirectRpc"
has been extracted from this project to be a independent project named "SnifferMouse". "SnifferMouse" currently has
its first release as version 0.0.1 and a well organized Wiki guiding anyone interested in using it to monitor remote 
outputs.

Again thank you for your patient, and I promise the wiki of "DirectRpc" will be ready soon.
